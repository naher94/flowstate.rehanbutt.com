## Development Notes

Here is a checklist to review when adding a new workflow to the project:
- Create a `markdown` file into the `_workflows` collection
- Add the application, if new, to the `_data/apps.yml`
- Add the application brand color to `design-system.scss` as below
- Add the workflow type, if new, to the `_workflows` collection

```
//Brand color sample

&.agenda{
        @include mini-card($agenda-brand-color,$elevation);
      }
```
