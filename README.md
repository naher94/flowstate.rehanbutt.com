# Flowstate

### Flowstate is a library of walkthrough teardowns & design patterns from the digital products all around us. Explore trends and gain insights from the industry as a whole.

## Development Notes

Here is a checklist to review when adding a new workflow to the project:
- Create a `markdown` file into the `_workflows` collection
- Add the application, if new, to the `_data/apps.yml`
- Add the application brand color to `design-system.scss`
  - `&.agenda{ @include mini-card($agenda-brand-color,$elevation);}`
- Add the workflow type, if new, to the `_flow-types` collection

Note that the `flow-type` value on a `_workflow` file needs to match the exact string of the `name` from the `md` file in the `_flow-type` directory
